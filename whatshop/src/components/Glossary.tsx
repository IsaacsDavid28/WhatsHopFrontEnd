            <h1>Types of Breweries</h1>
            <h2>Bar</h2>
            <p>Kinda self-explanatory.  This is a restaurant/pub/etc. that serves beer without a brewery on site.</p>
            <h2>Brewpub</h2>
            <p>We're stepping up here.  This is a kind of restaurant/bar/pub/etc. that also has it's own brewery at the location.  Sometimes it will sell it's beer offsite</p>
            <h2>Nano</h2>
            <p>Size doesn't matter but sales helps!  These are the smallest breweries around and usually serve local areas.</p>
            <h2>Micro</h2>
            <p>A step up from the nano breweries.  These are more established and sell up to 15,000 barrels' worth of beer a year. (Example: Samuel Adams)</p>
            <h2>Regional</h2>
            <p>Taking a leap forward in sales, regional breweries sell from 15,000 up to 6,000,000 barrels a year.</p>
            <h2>Large</h2>
            <p>Now we're in the big leagues, selling more than 6,000,000 million barrels a year.  Major names like Budweiser make up these breweries.  Though, don't expect them to be open for visitors.</p>
            <h2>Contract</h2>
            <p>These breweries are distinguished by the fact that they use equipment from other breweries.  Should be good brew nonetheless!</p>
            <h2>Proprietor</h2>
            <p>Similar to contracting breweries but they share the same equipment and are more of an incubator.</p>
            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>Under Construction!  These breweries are in the works and not yet open to the public.</p>
            <h2>Closed</h2>
            <p>*Sad Face* These breweries have passed on over the rainbow bridge.  May their craft brews rest in peace.</p>
